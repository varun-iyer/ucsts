Join us on Friday at 6PST for a conversation with the founder of LA Animal Save, Amy Jean Davis! 
Amy Jean Davis grew up in a small town outside Chicago. She always loved animals and that love combined with an interest in nutrition brought her inevitably to veganism in 2002 while a student at Purdue University. She came to Los Angeles in 2008 as a top 24 Finalist on the television singing show American Idol. Upon learning that humans are actually healthier as vegans she became more active in the animal rights world.  In 2016 Amy started LA Animal Save with the help of her partner, Shaun Monson, the filmmaker behind EARTHLINGS and UNITY. Since then she has helped grow LA Animal Save into one of the largest Animal Save groups in the world with frequent visits by celebrity vegans, mass media coverage, and hundreds of vigil attendees every week. She is also a part of Love Always Sanctuary and enjoys taking her vegan daughter there to visit with the animals.
