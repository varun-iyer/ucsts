Non-humans are exploited from the day they are born and until their last moments on earth.
Exploited in every way possible. Treated like machines. This is a nightmare they can’t wake up from. Most don’t ever get to feel the sunlight against their skin or the comfort of their mothers. The only way to combat this cruel treatment of non-human animals is to go vegan. It’s the *least* we can do. Like the old saying goes, treat others as you would like to be treated. 

The true reality behind what most people eat is made of nightmares. Unfortunately, most people believe the fabricated myth that their “food” came from loving farms where the animals lived in idyllic conditions. Why is this? We’ve been fed these stories to ignore the trillions of victims that are involved in our food choices. 

It takes one slaughterhouse or factory farm footage to change the pre-wired perception of what we call food. Cows crying for their children who were taken away from them, animals screaming at the top of their lungs in the slaughterhouse, and sows who are put in cages where they can’t even turn around. This is the reality of meat

This is how the industry treats mothers. As machines. As a means to an end. When they are no longer of “value,” they are murdered. No one wants Wilber to be killed in Charlotte’s Web. We are rooting for his survival, yet most people don’t know the role they play in this vicious cycle.

 Bearing witness (comforting animals before they are about to get slaughtered) can help make this connection between one’s food preferences and the beautiful sentient beings behind those choices. At Farmer Johns in Los Angeles, we give water to pigs in trucks who are about to be murdered. 

Often, pigs will fight each other for water because they have been without water for days. Farmer John’s doesn’t want to waste any resources on them. Sometimes, they just want to be petted. 

Pigs have come up to me for that sole purpose, to be comforted. One pig even licked me as I was petting her.
After all human beings have done to them, they are willing to see the good in us.
It’s beautifully tragic.
When you look into their eyes, being vegan makes sense. We have the power to change their lives by going vegan.
