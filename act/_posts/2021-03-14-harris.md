Harris Ranch, the largest slaughter-house on the West Coast, has innumerable cases of animal abuse, worker exploitation, and contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. In their facilities, employees are forced to slit the throats of line animals --- a violation of federal animal protection law. [For decades](https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2012-aug-22-la-me-0822-slaughterhouse-20120822-story.html), animal activists have been protesting human and animal abuse at their facilities.

Workers have sued Harris for [racial discrimination](https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article244447347.html) and protested [unsafe working conditions](https://hanfordsentinel.com/news/local/former-employees-say-hanford-plant-unsafe/article_5bf78bfc-46d3-11e0-ae4a-001cc4c002e0.html) as far back as 2011. In 2012, Harris Ranch’s parent company, the Central Valley Meat Company (CVMC), was even forced to close another facility after 72-year old Leopoldo Guitierrez was [crushed to death](https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2012-aug-22-la-me-0822-slaughterhouse-20120822-story.html)  in a meat grinder. Most recently, [150 positive cases of COVID-19](https://abc30.com/central-valley-meat-company-hanford-coronavirus-kings-county/6164914/) were found at facilities under supervision of the CVMC, illustrating a pattern of abuse by the company for both humans and animals.

Lastly, Central Valley is the [second-worst hot-spot](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/10/09/mysterious-sources-of-methane-viewed-from-space-makes-central-california-2nd-worst-hot-spot-in-nation-agriculture-nasa-global-warming-fresno-livestock/)  for methane emissions in America -- and cow feedlots (of which Harris Ranch is the largest) accounts for [one-third of those emissions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123744).
Such pollution harms surrounding communities of color living around Harris Ranch -- with increased prevalence of asthma and cardiac arrest. These practices indicative of a pattern of environmental racism practiced by the industry.

## Take Action Now!
The UC’s contract with Harris Ranch expires in June, but the Office of the President is renewing it despite concerns of students. You can make your voice heard by taking any of the following actions:
1. [Sign the petition](#)
2. Send a message to Eric Pollack ([eric.pollack@ucop.edu](mailto:eric.pollack@ucop.edu)), head of UC purchasing, letting them know that you oppose the Harris Ranch contract, and would support negotiations with plant-based suppliers instead. Here’s a template you can use, but please do make it your own!

> My name is [name] and I am a [UC student/alumnus/facilty/staff/concerned citizen], and I am writing to you with severe concerns about Harris Ranch, and animal supplier with which UC has active purchasing contracts. Cruelties perpetuated by Harris Ranch have recently been documented and shared with the world. It is despicable that the UC system is using student funds to support this business. Harris Ranch actively profits from the exploitation and mistreatment of humans and nonhumans, causing severe damage to the environment. I am writing to you to urge you not to renew the UC contract with Harris Ranch, and to instead pursue procurement contracts for ethical plant-based foods to support the UC's commitments to building a more just, equitable, and sustainable world.
> Please hold the UCs to a higher standard for the environment, for humans and for the nonhuman animals with whom we share this world.
> Thank you,
